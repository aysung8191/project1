SEIR 1212 - Project 1 - BlackJack

I decided to make BlackJack for my first project using HTML/CSS/JavaScript. 

## BlackJack Game Overview:
Blackjack, also commonly known as twenty-one, is a comparing card game between player(s) and the dealer, where the players competes against the dealer based on their turn. The objective of the game is to beat the dealer in one of the following ways: 
  1. Reach 21 on the player's first draw (first two cards) - called a "blackjack", without a dealer also hitting blackjack. 
  2. Reach a final score higher than the dealer without exceeding 21.
  3. Let the dealer draw additional cards until their hand exceeds 21 - called a "bust". 

## Game Highlights:
* Ace as a special card is evaluated as "1" or "11" depending on player's cards at hand. When a player draws an Ace and the score exceeds 21, the Ace value changes to 1. 
* 5 Decks are used to prevent counting cards.
* The Decks are generated and then shuffled before the start of the game.
